This is because it both defaults to SHA1, a cryptographic hash algorithm considered insecure since at least 2005 and defaults to one single iteration, a \"strength\" or \"difficulty\" value specified at 1,000 when specified in 1993. PBKDF2 relies on the iteration count as a countermeasure to preimage and collision attacks. If used to protect passwords, the impact is high. If used to generate signatures, the impact is high. As a workaround, configure crypto-js to use SHA256 with at least 250,000 iterations.\n## References\n* [https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-xwcq-pm8m-c4vf](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-xwcq-pm8m-c4vf)\n* [https://github.com/brix/crypto-js/commit/421dd538b2d34e7c24a5b72cc64dc2b9167db40a](https://github.com/brix/crypto-js/commit/421dd538b2d34e7c24a5b72cc64dc2b9167db40a)",

This is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary stat calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are created. This logic was insufficient when extracting tar files that contained both a directory and a symlink with the same name as the directory, where the symlink and directory names in the archive entry used backslashes as a path separator on posix systems. The cache checking logic used both `\\` and `/` characters as path separators, however `\\` is a valid filename character on posix systems. By first creating a directory, and then replacing that directory with a symlink, it was thus possible to bypass node-tar symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar file to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary files into that location, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite. Additionally, a similar confusion could arise on case-insensitive filesystems. If a tar archive contained a directory at `FOO`, followed by a symbolic link named `foo`, then on case-insensitive file systems, the creation of the symbolic link would remove the directory from the filesystem, but _not_ from the internal directory cache, as it would not be treated as a cache hit. A subsequent file entry within the `FOO` directory would then be placed in the target of the symbolic link, thinking that the directory had already been created. These issues were addressed in releases 4.4.16, 5.0.8 and 6.1.7. The v3 branch of node-tar has been deprecated and did not receive patches for these issues. If you are still using a v3 release we recommend you update to a more recent version of node-tar.

Additionally, on Windows systems, long path portions would resolve to the same file system entities as their 8.3 \"short path\" counterparts. A specially crafted tar archive could thus include a directory with one form of the path, followed by a symbolic link with a different string that resolves to the same file system entity, followed by a file using the first form. By first creating a directory, and then replacing that directory with a symlink that had a different apparent name that resolved to the same entry in the filesystem, it was thus possible to bypass node-tar symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar file to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary files into that location, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite. These issues were addressed in releases 4.4.18, 5.0.10 and 6.1.9. The v3 branch of node-tar has been deprecated and did not receive patches for these issues.

Eventually, the JavaScript heap limit is reached, and the program will crash.\n## References\n* [https://advisory.checkmarx.net/advisory/CVE-2024-4068/](https://advisory.checkmarx.net/advisory/CVE-2024-4068/)\n* [https://github.com/micromatch/braces/issues/35](https://github.com/micromatch/braces/issues/35)\n* [https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-grv7-fg5c-xmjg](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-grv7-fg5c-xmjg)\n* [https://github.com/micromatch/braces/pull/37](https://github.com/micromatch/braces/pull/37)\n* [https://github.com/micromatch/braces/pull/40](https://github.com/micromatch/braces/pull/40)\n* [https://github.com/micromatch/braces/commit/415d660c3002d1ab7e63dbf490c9851da80596ff](https://github.com/micromatch/braces/commit/415d660c3002d1ab7e63dbf490c9851da80596ff)",

This issue affects idna versions prior to 3.7. \n## References\n* [https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-jjg7-2v4v-x38h](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-jjg7-2v4v-x38h)\n* [https://github.com/kjd/idna/releases/tag/v3.7](https://github.com/kjd/idna/releases/tag/v3.7)\n* [https://huntr.com/bounties/93d78d07-d791-4b39-a845-cbfabc44aadb](https://huntr.com/bounties/93d78d07-d791-4b39-a845-cbfabc44aadb)",

The webpack developers have discovered a DOM Clobbering vulnerability in Webpack's \"AutoPublicPathRuntimeModule\". The DOM Clobbering gadget in the module can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in web pages where scriptless attacker-controlled HTML elements (e.g., an \"img\" tag with an unsanitized \"name\" attribute) are present. Real-world exploitation of this gadget has been observed in the Canvas LMS which allows an XSS attack to happen through a javascript code compiled by Webpack (the vulnerable part is from Webpack). DOM Clobbering is a type of code-reuse attack where the attacker first embeds a piece of non-script, seemingly benign HTML markups in the webpage (e.g. through a post or comment) and leverages the gadgets (pieces of js code) living in the existing javascript code to transform it into executable code. This vulnerability can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) on websites that include Webpack-generated files and allow users to inject certain scriptless HTML tags with improperly sanitized name or id attributes.

Its main purpose is to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling, or packaging just about any resource or asset. The webpack developers have discovered a DOM Clobbering vulnerability in Webpack's \"AutoPublicPathRuntimeModule\". The DOM Clobbering gadget in the module can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in web pages where scriptless attacker-controlled HTML elements (e.g., an \"img\" tag with an unsanitized \"name\" attribute) are present. Real-world exploitation of this gadget has been observed in the Canvas LMS which allows an XSS attack to happen through a javascript code compiled by Webpack (the vulnerable part is from Webpack). DOM Clobbering is a type of code-reuse attack where the attacker first embeds a piece of non-script, seemingly benign HTML markups in the webpage (e.g. through a post or comment) and leverages the gadgets (pieces of js code) living in the existing javascript code to transform it into executable code. This vulnerability can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) on websites that include Webpack-generated files and allow users to inject certain scriptless HTML tags with improperly sanitized name or id attributes. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.

In affected versions, an oversight in how the Jinja sandboxed environment detects calls to `str.format` allows an attacker who controls the content of a template to execute arbitrary Python code. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker needs to control the content of a template. Whether that is the case depends on the type of application using Jinja. This vulnerability impacts users of applications that execute untrusted templates. Jinja's sandbox does catch calls to `str.format` and ensures they don't escape the sandbox. However, it's possible to store a reference to a malicious string's `format` method, and then pass that to a filter that calls it. No such filters are built-in to Jinja, but they could be present through custom filters in an application. After the fix, such indirect calls are also handled by the sandbox.

An application attempting to mitigate Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) or Open Redirect vulnerabilities by disabling redirects at the `PoolManager` level will remain vulnerable.\n## References\n* [https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-pq67-6m6q-mj2v](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-pq67-6m6q-mj2v)\n* [https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/releases/tag/2.5.0](https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/releases/tag/2.5.0)\n* [https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/commit/f05b1329126d5be6de501f9d1e3e36738bc08857](https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/commit/f05b1329126d5be6de501f9d1e3e36738bc08857)",

When using urllib3's proxy support with `ProxyManager`, the `Proxy-Authorization` header is only sent to the configured proxy, as expected. However, when sending HTTP requests without using urllib3's proxy support, it's possible to accidentally configure the `Proxy-Authorization` header even though it won't have any effect as the request is not using a forwarding proxy or a tunneling proxy. In those cases, urllib3 doesn't treat the `Proxy-Authorization` HTTP header as one carrying authentication material and thus doesn't strip the header of cross-origin redirects. Because this is a highly unlikely scenario, we believe the severity of this vulnerability is low for almost all users. Out of an abundance of caution, urllib3 will automatically strip the `Proxy-Authorization` header during cross-origin redirects to avoid the small chance that users are doing this by accident. Users should use urllib3's proxy support or disable automatic redirects to achieve safe processing of the `Proxy-Authorization` header, but we still decided to strip the header by default in order to further protect users who aren't using the correct approach. We believe the amount of usage affected by this advisory is low. It requires all the following to be true to be exploited: 1.

Setting the `Proxy-Authorization` header without using urllib3's built-in proxy support. 2. Not disabling HTTP redirects. 3. Either not using an HTTPS origin server or for the proxy or target origin to redirect to a malicious origin. This vulnerability affects urllib3 versions prior to 1.26.19, and 2.x prior to 2.2.2. Users are advised to update to a fixed version. Users unable to upgrade may use the `Proxy-Authorization` header with urllib3's `ProxyManager`, disable HTTP redirects using `redirects=False` when sending requests, or not use the `Proxy-Authorization` header as mitigation.\n## References\n* [https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-34jh-p97f-mpxf](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-34jh-p97f-mpxf)\n* [https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/commit/accff72ecc2f6cf5a76d9570198a93ac7c90270e](https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/commit/accff72ecc2f6cf5a76d9570198a93ac7c90270e)\n* [https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/blob/2.2.2/CHANGES.rst](https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/blob/2.2.2/CHANGES.rst)",

Although this behavior is not specified in the section for redirects, it can be inferred by piecing together information from different sections and we have observed the behavior in other major HTTP client implementations like curl and web browsers.

Additionally, many users aren't putting sensitive data in HTTP request bodies. If this is the case, then this vulnerability isn't exploitable. Both of the following conditions must be true to be affected by this vulnerability: 1. Using urllib3 and submitting sensitive information to the HTTP request body (such as form data or JSON) and 2.

That's\ngood, but we missed a little bit.\n\nBefore that commit, we used to _first_ run through the\ndrm_gem_mmap_obj() case where `obj->funcs->mmap()` was NULL. That meant\nthat we ran:\n\n  vma->vm_flags |= VM_IO | VM_PFNMAP | VM_DONTEXPAND | VM_DONTDUMP;\n  vma->vm_page_prot = pgprot_writecombine(vm_get_page_prot(vma->vm_flags));\n  vma->vm_page_prot = pgprot_decrypted(vma->vm_page_prot);\n\n...and _then_ we modified those mappings with our own.

                "text": "CVE-2021-47460\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nocfs2: fix data corruption after conversion from inline format\n\nCommit 6dbf7bb55598 (\"fs: Don't invalidate page buffers in\nblock_write_full_page()\") uncovered a latent bug in ocfs2 conversion\nfrom inline inode format to a normal inode format.\n\nThe code in ocfs2_convert_inline_data_to_extents() attempts to zero out\nthe whole cluster allocated for file data by grabbing, zeroing, and\ndirtying all pages covering this cluster.

In this situation value of\nargument 'state' is above nominal fan speed maximum.\n\nReturn non-zero code in this case to avoid\nthermal_cooling_device_stats_update() call, because in this case\nstatistics update violates thermal statistics table range.\nThe issues is observed in case kernel is configured with option\nCONFIG_THERMAL_STATISTICS.\n\nHere is the trace from KASAN:\n[  159.506659] BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in thermal_cooling_device_stats_update+0x7d/0xb0\n[  159.516016] Read of size 4 at addr ffff888116163840 by task hw-management.s/7444\n[  159.545625] Call Trace:\n[  159.548366]  dump_stack+0x92/0xc1\n[  159.552084]  ? thermal_cooling_device_stats_update+0x7d/0xb0\n[  159.635869]  thermal_zone_device_update+0x345/0x780\n[  159.688711]  thermal_zone_device_set_mode+0x7d/0xc0\n[  159.694174]  mlxsw_thermal_modules_init+0x48f/0x590 [mlxsw_core]\n[  159.700972]  ? mlxsw_thermal_set_cur_state+0x5a0/0x5a0 [mlxsw_core]\n[  159.731827]  mlxsw_thermal_init+0x763/0x880 [mlxsw_core]\n[  160.070233] RIP: 0033:0x7fd995909970\n[  160.074239] Code: 73 01 c3 48 8b 0d 28 d5 2b 00 f7 d8 64 89 01 48 83 c8 ff c3 66 0f 1f 44 00 00 83 3d 99 2d 2c 00 00 75 10 b8 01 00 00 00 0f 05 <48> 3d 01 f0 ff ..\n[  160.095242] RSP: 002b:00007fff54f5d938 EFLAGS: 00000246 ORIG_RAX: 0000000000000001\n[  160.103722] RAX: ffffffffffffffda RBX: 0000000000000013 RCX: 00007fd995909970\n[  160.111710] RDX: 0000000000000013 RSI: 0000000001906008 RDI: 0000000000000001\n[  160.119699] RBP: 0000000001906008 R08: 00007fd995bc9760 R09: 00007fd996210700\n[  160.127687] R10: 0000000000000073 R11: 0000000000000246 R12: 0000000000000013\n[  160.135673] R13: 0000000000000001 R14: 00007fd995bc8600 R15: 0000000000000013\n[  160.143671]\n[  160.145338] Allocated by task 2924:\n[  160.149242]  kasan_save_stack+0x19/0x40\n[  160.153541]  __kasan_kmalloc+0x7f/0xa0\n[  160.157743]  __kmalloc+0x1a2/0x2b0\n[  160.161552]  thermal_cooling_device_setup_sysfs+0xf9/0x1a0\n[  160.167687]  __thermal_cooling_device_register+0x1b5/0x500\n[  160.173833]  devm_thermal_of_cooling_device_register+0x60/0xa0\n[  160.180356]  mlxreg_fan_probe+0x474/0x5e0 [mlxreg_fan]\n[  160.248140]\n[  160.249807] The buggy address belongs to the object at ffff888116163400\n[  160.249807]  which belongs to the cache kmalloc-1k of size 1024\n[  160.263814] The buggy address is located 64 bytes to the right of\n[  160.263814]  1024-byte region [ffff888116163400, ffff888116163800)\n[  160.277536] The buggy address belongs to the page:\n[  160.282898] page:0000000012275840 refcount:1 mapcount:0 mapping:0000000000000000 index:0xffff888116167000 pfn:0x116160\n[  160.294872] head:0000000012275840 order:3 compound_mapcount:0 compound_pincount:0\n[  160.303251] flags: 0x200000000010200(slab|head|node=0|zone=2)\n[  160.309694] raw: 0200000000010200 ffffea00046f7208 ffffea0004928208 ffff88810004dbc0\n[  160.318367] raw: ffff888116167000 00000000000a0006 00000001ffffffff 0000000000000000\n[  160.327033] page dumped because: kasan: bad access detected\n[  160.333270]\n[  160.334937] Memory state around the buggy address:\n[  160.356469] >ffff888116163800: fc ..\n\n\n[Details](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-47393)",
